        This is a small application to calculate the SEGUID and cSEGUID checksums for a biological sequences such as DNA, RNA or proteins.
        
        Seguid-calculator is written in python and uses wxPython for the GUI.
        
        Seguid-calculator is available as source code, a windows executable made with Pyinstaller 
        and a Jython/Swing version that should work on any platform with a Java runtime environment.

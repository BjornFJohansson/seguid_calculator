Is a small GUI application to calculate the SEGUID and cSEGUID checksums for a biological sequence (DNA, RNA or protein). 
The SEGUID checksum is the [SHA-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) cryptographic hash of the primary biological 
sequence in uppercase. SEGUID was suggested by [Babnigg and Giometti ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16858731) 
to provide stable identifiers of protein sequences in databases for cross referencing.

cSEGUID is the SEGUID for circular sequences. cSEGUID is the SEGUID of the 
[lexicographically minimal string rotation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographically_minimal_string_rotation) 
of a sequence or its reverse complement (whichever is smallest). The cSEGUID provide a unique and stable identifier for 
circular sequence, such as [plasmids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid).

Seguid_calculator is written in python 2.7 with wxPython 3.0.2. seguid_calculator is available as 
[source code](), a windows 
executable made with Pyinstaller on [Appveyor](), 
Mac OS executables built on Travis ci and as a [.deb package]() built on Drone.io 
using [stdeb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb)


Windows executables can be downloaded [here]

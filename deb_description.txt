Seguid_calculator is a small GUI application for calculating the SEGUID, cSEGUID and lSEGUID checksums for biological
sequences, DNA, RNA or protein.

  The SEGUID checksum is defined as the SHA-1 cryptographic hash of a primary biological sequence in uppercase.

SEGUID was first suggested by Babnigg and Giometti (1) as a way to provide stable
identifiers of protein sequences in databases for cross referencing.

The checksum produced from this software is an URL safe version of the SEGUID, which means that does not
contain characters that can cause errors if the SEGUID is used as a filename or a part of a URL. The
character - is used instead of + and _ instead of / in the standard Base64 alphabet.
The SEGUID can still contain =.
